## Improved Method for Task Management:

1. Input start time, end time, and break minutes into the timesheet.
2. If a task is incomplete at the end of the day, utilize the timer app for breaks instead of stopping it.
3. This ensures task hours continue, and break minutes persist until the task is completed.

*Tip:* If a task seems unlikely to be completed by EOD, break it into smaller, manageable steps. Focus on completing the current step by EOD, reducing stress and improving productivity.


### Rationale:

Persistent thoughts about an unfinished task can make your downtime feel like work, leading to burnout and fatigue. By following the improved method, you create a more effective work-rest balance.


### Objective:

Shift your perspective on leaving tasks incomplete overnight or across days off. Embrace shorter tasks and adopt effective techniques for task and time management to enhance overall productivity and well-being.
